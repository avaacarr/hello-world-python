"Hello, World" in python

This "Hello, World" program took me about 2.5 hours to complete. This took me so long because I had some problems downloading python and downloading it in the proper spot on my computer. However, I got some help from my teammates and I got it to work. Once I completed this "Hello, World" program for python, I was excited.
